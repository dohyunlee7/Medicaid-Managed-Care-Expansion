Notes,,,
"Data are as of July 1, 2021.",,,
,,,
"Medicaid Enrollment in Comprehensive Managed Care represents an unduplicated count of Medicaid enrollees enrolled in a managed care plan that provides comprehensive benefits (acute, primary care, specialty, and any other). Enrollment data includes dual eligible enrollees. Errors/corrections identified in CMS enrollment reports (for prior year data) have been incorporated here.",,,
,,,
"Enrollees who are enrolled in PACE programs are excluded. Additionally, enrollment in Idaho's duals plans and Vermont's public managed care model are also excluded.",,,
,,,
"For more table and state specific notes, please see Table 2 in CMS' [Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Reports](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/managed-care/enrollment/index.html).",,,

Definitions,,,
*Comprehensive Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)*: MCOs provide all acute and primary  medical services; some also cover behavioral health and long term care. Entities that qualify as MCOs include Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Health Insuring Organizations (HIOs in  California).,,,
,,,
*N/A*: Not applicable. The state had no contracts with comprehensive MCOs.,,,

Footnotes,,,
1. United States total excludes data from Puerto Rico.,,,
"2. This indicator includes enrollment in comprehensive MCOs (as defined above). Data are pulled from Table 2 in the CMS Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Report which presents enrollment in comprehensive MCOs for Medicaid-only and dual eligible enrollees. However, in CA, HI, OR, and TN, we identified and removed behavioral health-only, dental-only, and other limited benefit plan enrollment that were defined as ""comprehensive"" by CMS. Therefore, total enrollment in this indicator for CA, HI, OR, and TN may not match total enrollment in Table 2 in the CMS Enrollment Report.",,,
"3. MA’s share of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in comprehensive MCOs includes individuals enrolled in comprehensive managed care plans and in ""Partnership"" Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) (known as ACO Model A), which are fully capitated and linked to a health plan. Primary Care ACOs (referred to as ACO Model B) are not included as they are not capitated",,,
"4. In 2020, Michigan updated their reporting methodology to more accurately calculate overall Medicaid and managed care enrollment resulting in a significant decrease in enrollment counts between 2019 and 2020.",,,
