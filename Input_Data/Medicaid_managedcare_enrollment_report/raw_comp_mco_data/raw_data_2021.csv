Notes,,,
"Data are as of July 1, 2021.",,,
,,,
"Medicaid Enrollment in Comprehensive Managed Care represents an unduplicated count of Medicaid enrollees enrolled in a managed care plan that provides comprehensive benefits (acute, primary care, specialty, and any other). Enrollment data includes dual eligible enrollees. Errors/corrections identified in CMS enrollment reports (for prior year data) have been incorporated here.",,,
,,,
"Enrollees who are enrolled in PACE programs are excluded. Additionally, enrollment in Idaho's duals plans and Vermont's public managed care model are also excluded.",,,
,,,
"For more table and state specific notes, please see Table 2 in CMS' [Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Reports](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/managed-care/enrollment/index.html).",,,

Definitions,,,
*Comprehensive Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)*: MCOs provide all acute and primary  medical services; some also cover behavioral health and long term care. Entities that qualify as MCOs include Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Health Insuring Organizations (HIOs in  California).,,,
,,,
*N/A*: Not applicable. The state had no contracts with comprehensive MCOs.,,,

Footnotes,,,
1. United States total excludes data from Puerto Rico.,,,
"2. This indicator includes enrollment in comprehensive MCOs (as defined above). Data are pulled from Table 2 in the 2021 CMS Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Report which presents enrollment in comprehensive MCOs for Medicaid-only and dual eligible enrollees. However, in CA and OR, we identified and removed dental-only and other limited benefit plan enrollment that were incorrectly categorized as comprehensive MCO enrollment. Additionally, in AZ, we identified and added comprehensive MCO enrollment incorrectly categorized as limited benefit plan enrollment. Therefore, total enrollment in this indicator for AZ, CA, and OR may not match total enrollment in CMS Table 2.",,,
"3. In 2021, Michigan reported a number for total enrollment in comprehensive managed care that was greater than total Medicaid enrollment, but did not provide an explanation for why this number was greater.",,,
