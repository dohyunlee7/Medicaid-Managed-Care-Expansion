Notes,,,
"Data are as of July 1, 2022.",,,
,,,
"Medicaid Enrollment in Comprehensive Managed Care represents an unduplicated count of Medicaid enrollees enrolled in a managed care plan that provides comprehensive benefits (acute, primary care, specialty, and any other). Enrollment data includes dual eligible enrollees. Errors/corrections identified in CMS enrollment reports (for prior year data) have been incorporated here.",,,
,,,
"Excludes enrollment in PACE programs. Excludes enrollment in Vermont’s public managed care model. While enrollment in Idaho's plans for dual-eligible individuals is categorized by CMS and counted here in 2022 as MCO enrollment, KFF does not consider Idaho a Medicaid MCO state in other Medicaid managed care work (since the plans are secondary to Medicare).",,,

Footnotes,,,
1. United States total excludes data from Puerto Rico.,,,
"2. This indicator includes enrollment in comprehensive MCOs (as defined above). Data are pulled from Table 2 in the  2022 CMS Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Report which presents enrollment in comprehensive MCOs for Medicaid-only and dually eligible enrollees. However, using plan-level information in CMS Table 5, we identified and removed limited benefit plan enrollment incorrectly categorized as comprehensive MCO enrollment in IL, OR, and WA . Additionally, we identified and added comprehensive MCO enrollment incorrectly categorized as limited benefit plan enrollment in AZ and PCCM enrollment in CO. Therefore, total enrollment in this indicator for AZ, CO, IL, OR, and WA may not match total enrollment in CMS Table 2.",,,
3. TN's comprehensive MCO enrollment is listed as missing in Table 2 of the CMS report. The value shown here uses the plan-level enrollment in Table 5 to produce a count of total comprehensive MCO enrollment in TN.,,,
